# node-cryptojs

This is a wrapper around Jeff Mott's CryptoJS library.  It tracks the most
recent version of his software (available here: https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/)
and puts it into a Common-JS export framework.

There are several other projects that do the same thing, such as:

  * https://github.com/gwjjeff/cryptojs
  * https://github.com/evanvosberg/crypto-js

This one is not as fancy, but is just what's currently required for
